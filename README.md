# Spacecraft-Pose-Estimator

📖 Overview

This project estimates the 3D pose of spacecraft using a trained deep learning model. Given an input image, the model outputs:

  Orientation as a quaternion vector (qₓ, qᵧ, q𝓏, q𝓌)
  Translation (x, y, z) representing position

It also provides:

  Confidence score

  Downloadable report (ZIP)

  Visualizations (Radar chart, 3D scatter plot)
